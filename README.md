# Ari's Python links and tips

My Python links and tips.

## Links

Links to pages I've found interesting. I don't necessarily recommend anything,
this is partly a list for things to check.

The most important site is obviously python.org. From there one can find
tutorials for absolute beginners and programmers alike.
